fix build on github -- will be fixed by moving to java11 :)
allow to change encryption setting on a loaded file whose all encrypted values have been decrypted.
allow to edit configuration files
on large file do not require to scroll down upon each encryption
save password in metadata encrypted asking for a master password upon save/load :) ? does it sounds good ? :)
use dedicated threads to proceed to encryption instead of stealing the main application thread! <- not really a need for now... didn't had any unacceptable lag issue.
enhance readme to add some usage animated gifs....
