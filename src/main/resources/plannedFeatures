fix build on github
upon encryption failure caused by the selection of a too strong algorithm, do not lock encryption setting panel in UI
blocked multiple open file windows to be opened simultaneously
change icon of open file feature
allow to select string to encrypt by regexp
allow to edit configuration files
user feedback on errors ( none should happen in truth! :) )
hide password type in to only display dot or stars
save password in metadata encrypted asking for a master password upon save/load :) ? does it sounds good ? :)
use dedicated threads to proceed to encryption instead of stealing the main application thread!
