fix build on github
allow to change encryption setting on a loaded file whose all encrypted values have been decrypted.
allow to select string to encrypt by regexp
allow to edit configuration files
for encryption/decryption check the user actually selected something
user feedback on decrypting errors
hide password type in to only display dot or stars
save password in metadata encrypted asking for a master password upon save/load :) ? does it sounds good ? :)
use dedicated threads to proceed to encryption instead of stealing the main application thread!
enhance readme to add some usage animated gifs....
